The "Search" mode is designed to analyze the operational ("raw") data of the device and search for a source of radiation or heterogeneity of radiation fields. The data is displayed in several graphical representations for two measurement channels – count rate and/or dose rate.

The operational data is raw gamma radiation data that is sent to the application from the device in real time every 500 ms. The application stores this data for the last 10 minutes. The values of the operational data vary widely and are characterized by a high random measurement error. With an increase in the level of recorded radiation, this error decreases.

The ![[Images/_navbuttons0.png]]button, when held or pressed, allows you to select display options:

· The count rate in the form of an arrow indicator and a graph 
· Dose rate in the form of an arrow indicator and a graph  
· The count rate and dose rate in the form of arrow indicators

Graphs always display operational data in the form in which they come from the device, without any processing. The data displayed on the arrow indicator is averaged: the arithmetic mean is calculated over a time interval that can be specified in the settings.

**Analog arrow indicator**

The indicator is a fixed linear scale with divisions from 0 to 100 and an arrow. The scale is colored according to the alarm thresholds set in the dosimeter (see Device settings). To get readings corresponding to the position of the arrow, you need to multiply the value on the scale by the coefficient active in the list to the right of the indicator.

In the center of the arrow indicator is a numeric value that reflects the current value of the data. The units of measurement are located under the indicator. The name of the measured value is displayed in the upper left corner. There is a bright circle marker at the end of the arrow for greater contrast.

There are two dynamically changing zones along the circumference on the surface of the indicator scale. The blue statistics area displays the maximum and minimum range of values registered since the application was launched or since the statistics were reset.

The cyan zone on top of the blue one displays the oscillation range of the arrow, the boundaries of which dynamically indicate the activity zone and the direction of the arrow displacement.

**Graph**

The graph shows the operational data coming from the device. It is similar to the graphs on the ["Charts" tab](main_screen.htm), with the following features:

•Time scales – from 1 to 10 minutes.

•The scale of the Y-axis is linear, logarithmic, square root.

•Scaling the graph along the Y-axis – over the entire range (up to 10 minutes), or over the area visible on the screen. Manual scaling is not available.

•The right border of the graph always corresponds to the current moment in time.

Touching the graph displays a horizontal line that can be moved around the graph to accurately determine the value of the displayed value.

Averaging is necessary to reduce the range of fluctuations of the arrows and the boundaries of the statistical zones on the indicators. Averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean for the specified time interval. If you specify an interval equal to zero, then averaging will not be performed.<br><br>The graphs display the operational data "as is", without averaging.<br><br>**Average value graphs:** These graphs display the values of quantities averaged over several neighboring counts. Average value graphs are useful when the measured values are small and the random error is significant, for example, with a natural radiation background. For each reference, the averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean values to the right and left of this reference. For example, if the width of the averaging window is set to 7 counts, then averaging is performed by summing the value of the current count, three counts to the left of it, three to the right, and dividing the resulting sum by 7.<br><br>If the time gap between adjacent counts exceeds 5 minutes, then averaging is not performed. It is also not performed for samples that are at the very beginning and at the very end of the buffer, because there is not enough data to average.<br><br>The "Graph line thickness" option in this case selects the thickness of the graph lines of the average values relative to the thickness of the outline lines of the main (gray) graphs.<br><br>**Y-Axis Scale:** selection between linear, logarithmic and square root scales.<br><br>**Y-axis zoom mode:**  <br><br>•Across the entire range: minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated over the entire range of data
