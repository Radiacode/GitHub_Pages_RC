A form opens where you can send a letter with wishes to the developers or report bugs in the application. You need to enter your name and email, to which a reply will be sent, if requested. All the necessary technical information, including log files (logs), will be included in the report automatically.

If you want to report a bug in the application to the developers, then first make sure that the [Diagnostic Mode](#d_mode) option is enabled in the settings. In the diagnostic mode, the application generates an extended log file that can help developers. After enabling the diagnostic mode option, you need to restart the application.

Button **“Add file”** allows selecting files on your smartphone, such as screenshots, that will be included in the archive sent to the developers.
