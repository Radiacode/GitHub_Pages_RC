| If the device firmware requires an update, the firmware version number will be displayed in yellow. The device firmware is included in the application itself, so the application knows both the device firmware version and the firmware version for which the application is designed.<br><br>It is possible that the device has a newer firmware version than the one for which the application is designed. This happens when the device firmware has already been updated via RadiaCode for Windows and the app hasn't been updated yet. In this case, the firmware number is displayed in red and the application should be updated to GooglePlay, otherwise the correct operation of the application with the device is not guaranteed.<br><br>The main menu item “About RadiaCode” gives information about the version of the application and firmware, as well as their correspondence to one another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If several RadiaCode devices were connected to the application, then the readings of all these devices are stored in the database, but at each point in time, data corresponding to only one of them is displayed on graphs and in the log. If a device is connected to the application, the data corresponding to this particular device is displayed. If the device is not connected to the application and there are data from several devices in the database, then in the "Log" tab you can select which data of these devices to display.

| ![[Images/_doserate.png]] | If the graph displays the most recent data corresponding to real time, then on the right, in gray, operational data is displayed that was read by the device from its sensor, but was not yet processed (data processing and filtering algorithms need to accumulate a certain amount of data). Already processed and filtered values ?are displayed on the graphs in green/blue. Live data is stored for the last 10 minutes. |

One can control the live data filter that is displayed on the graph. You can set the width of the filtering window in the graph settings, i.e. the time over which the data is averaged. **Such averaging is performed by the device, serves only to display operational data** and is not related to data processing by the device, as a result of which the values displayed by color graphs are calculated.

On the dose rate graph, vertical colored lines with a circle at the top show the moments when alarms occurred. These lines can be disabled in the graph settings.

**Scale selection**

The displayed data can be displayed in linear, logarithmic and quadratic scales. The current scale name is displayed at the top left of the graph; it is the square root in the example.

The scale can be changed either explicitly in graph settings,, which are called by the button , or by double-tapping the graph. You can set your own scale for each graph.

**Y-axis zooming**

By default, the displayed plot area fills the entire area visible in the window along the Y axis. The horizontal grid always has 8 cells, and the digitization values ?a?re calculated dynamically based on the displayed data. It should be borne in mind that two additional points are involved in determining the maximum and minimum values o?f the visible area: one beyond the left border of the area and one beyond the right.

You can select automatic scaling along the Y-axis both in the current visible area and in the entire range of data available to the application in the graph settings. Each graph (count rate, dose rate) has its own setting.

Graphs can be moved along the Y-axis (up/down) by swiping your finger across the screen. Initially, to switch from automatic scaling to manual scaling, you need to move the graph up or down vigorously enough (protection against accidental shift during paging). In this case, automatic scaling is disabled, and the graph can be precisely positioned with gestures in order, for example, to find out the values i?n peaks.

With the pinch gesture on the screen, you can stretch and shrink graphs both vertically and horizontally. When pinching vertically, the auto zoom mode is also disabled.

The “A” button is both an indicator of the current zoom mode and a means of returning to the last auto zoom mode selected. The icon on the button corresponds to the selected mode:

| ![[Images/ic_auto_auto.png]]    | Both graphs are present on the screen and their scaling modes do not match. Tapping the button returns the last autoscaling mode selected in the settings for each graph. |

In graph settings, you can disable the transition to the manual scaling mode. In this case, attempts to shift the graphs and pinch along the Y axis are ignored, and the “A” button is highlighted in red.

**X-axis zooming**

Scaling of graphs along the X axis (time axis) is performed either by using the buttons ![[Images/ic_zoom_in.png]] and ![[Images/ic_zoom_out.png]] , or a pinch gesture. A long tap of the button increases the zoom to the maximum or decreases to the minimum.

**Scrolling**

Scrolling graphs horizontally is performed by usual gestures, as well as buttons ![[Images/ic_prev.png]]and ![[Images/ic_next.png]]. The buttons search for the previous/next piece of data after a break in time.  
A long tap of the button moves to the very beginning or, respectively, to the very end of the graph. The data is displayed in certain portions. When the limit is reached, a new piece of data is loaded from the database.

# 4.2  Pseudo-determination of isotopes by radiation hardness

The radiation hardness graph makes it possible at any time to estimate which energies predominate in the gamma-ray spectrum (low, medium, high). The application has a built-in table of hardness coefficients of reference values from ionizing radiation sources. Thanks to this table, it is possible to tell which isotope best corresponds to a particular hardness value.

The determination of isotopes is conditional. If, for example, the application has determined that the radiation hardness corresponds to the reference radiation hardness from, for example, caesium-137, then this only gives reason to assume that the radiation hardness is the same as that of the reference source of caesium-137. 

Also, pseudo-determination of isotopes will not work if there are several radionuclides in the sample or gamma field. 

In the graph settings, you can choose which isotopes from the table will participate in the pseudo- determination, and which will not. This allows you to disable the display of rare isotopes to reduce the likelihood of incorrect determination.

# 4.3 Graph settings

 Graph settings Graph settings are accessed with the button . The count rate and dose rate graphs have the same settings, individual for each graph. 
 
 **Show charts**: In the drop-down list, you can choose which charts to display. 
 
 **The width of the window for averaging operational data, when displayed on graphs**: time, over which the device averages operational data (operational data is displayed on the graphs in gray). Such averaging is performed by the device, serves only to display operational data and is not related to data processing by the device, as a result of which the values displayed by color graphs are calculated. An increase in the averaging time leads to a smoother, but less rapid reaction to changes in the radiation situation. 
 
 **Y-Axis Scale:** selection between linear, logarithmic and square root scales. You can also switch the scale by double-tapping the corresponding graph.
 
  **Y-axis zoom mode:** 
	  · Across the entire range: minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated over the entire range of data available to the application. In this mode, the digitization of the Y axis does not change, when scrolling the graph horizontally.
	   · By visible area: minimum and maximum values of the Y-axis data is calculated from the plot of data shown on the graph. When scrolling through the graph, as well as when new data from the device is received, these values will change. 
	   · Disabled: autoscale mode disabled. For autoscaling see Graph displaying. 
	   
**Display alarm events 1/2:** One can turn off the display of vertical colored lines on the dose rate graph, which correspond to the moments when alarms occur.

**Average value graphs:** These graphs display the values of quantities averaged over several neighboring counts. Average value graphs are useful when the measured values are small and the random error is significant, for example, with a natural radiation background. For each reference, the averaging is performed by calculating the arithmetic mean values to the right and left of this reference. For example, if the width of the averaging window is set to 7 counts, then averaging is performed by summing the value of the current count, three counts to the left of it, three to the right, and dividing the resulting sum by 7.

If the time gap between adjacent counts exceeds 5 minutes, then averaging is not performed. It is also not performed for samples that are at the very beginning and at the very end of the buffer, because there is not enough data to average.

The "Graph line thickness" option in this case selects the thickness of the graph lines of the average values relative to the line thickness of the main graphs. The other options of the group control the appearance of the main graphs.

**Graph settings:**

**Graph line thickness:** you can choose the thickness of the graph lines, in conventional units.

**Values ​​font size:** you can select the size of the digits for the count rate and dose rate, in conventional units.

**Indicator bar history:** You can select the time interval for which the blue zone will be displayed in the dose rate/count rate indicator. The blue zone shows the boundaries where the rate value was in the given time interval. If you select "Last .... minutes" option, the blue zone boundaries are updated every minute. If the real-time dose rate/count rate value coming from the device exceeds the current limits, the limits are updated according to the current value.

**The indicator bar shows:** Select which value the indicator displays - dose rate or count rate.

**Labels on graphs:** You can choose where the values of the measured values, together with the units of measurement and the error, will be located on the graphs - on the right or on the left. If you disable the "Show titles" option, the application will not display the names of the measured values ("Dose rate", "Count rate"...).

**Buttons and indicator bar:** you can choose between two layouts of the page with graphs: on one layout the control buttons and the graphical dose rate/count rate indicator are on the right side of the graphs, on the other one - on top, which gives the graphs more horizontal space. This option works only for the portrait orientation of the screen, with the horizontal orientation the buttons are always displayed on the right side.

**Disable scaling and shifting of graphs along the Y-axis:** do not switch to the mode of manual scaling of graphs along the Y-axis, when trying to shift graphs up/down and scaling with a vertical “pinch”.
