Connecting the application to the device RadiaCode

Before starting to work with the device, make sure that the power of the device is turned on.

When you start the application for the first time, it will automatically open device selection dialog. You can connect to the device via Bluetooth and USB interfaces. To connect the device to a phone/tablet via USB, you need to use an On-The-Go (OTG) cable.

>[!Warning] To connect the RadiaCode device to your smartphone via Bluetooth, you do not need to perform the device pairing procedure via your smartphone's Bluetooth settings. You do not need to enter any connection codes either.

Tap the “Bluetooth” label. If Bluetooth is not enabled in your phone, the application will ask you to enable it. Confirm that you allow the app to turn on Bluetooth. If your phone does not support Bluetooth version 4.0 (Android OS version is less than 6), a corresponding message will be displayed. The device cannot be operated with such a telephone via the Bluetooth interface.

Additionally, the app requires location access permission to function. This is a requirement of the Android OS to work with Bluetooth Low Energy.

Soon, the device name will appear in the “Choose device” field. “RadiaCode-10X”. This means that the application has found the device via the Bluetooth interface. Detection may take some time.

Tap the “OK” button at the bottom of the screen. Will open app home screen. Communication with the device will be established and the device will be initialized, which will take a few seconds.
