If the device is connected, then the device settings are available through the navigation menu (pictogram ![_NavMenu](Attachments/_navmenu%201.png)in the upper left corner of the screen). The device settings displayed in the application are read by the application from the device and correspond to the settings available through the menu of the device itself.

Please note that to transfer the settings to the device, you need to tap the button ![_Apply](Images/_apply.png) at the top right of the screen.

Measuring unit: You can choose microroentgens or Sieverts.

Device language: The language of inscriptions displayed on the device screen.

Dose Rate Alarms: Dose rate alarm thresholds can be set. If the registered emission level exceeds the specified values, then, depending on the settings ![ic_sound](Images/ic_sound.png) and ![ic_vibrate](Images/ic_vibrate.png), an audio signal and vibration are issued. In [the application settings,](settings.htm) you can set the smartphone to repeat the device alarms through its speaker.

Dose Alarms: You can set alarm thresholds for the level of the accumulated emission dose.

Count Rate Alarms: Count rate alarm thresholds can be set.

Alarm signals mode:

Continuously: When an alarm occurs, the device will generate the specified signals (sound and/or vibration) at certain intervals until the user presses the button on the device body or mutes the alarm sound from the application with the button ![_SoundOff](Images/_soundoff.png).

Once: Each time an alarm occurs, the device will issue the specified signals one time.

Display backlight: You can select the backlight operating mode of the device display.

Display rotation: You can select the mode of the image rotation on the device display. “Automatically” means that the device will itself determine the orientation of the image using the built-in accelerometer.

The “Calibration factors": the dialog box opens where you can manually adjust the values of the spectrum calibration factors, which are used by the device to convert the spectrum channel number into the radiation energy value in keV. In the application you can [calibrate the energy scale of the spectrum](calibrate.htm).

Device settings profiles

The device settings can be saved as profiles. All device settings and spectrum calibration factors are stored in the profile. To save a profile, tap the three dot icon in the upper right corner of the screen, select "Save Profile" and enter a name for the profile. Later on, you can load a profile from the profile library using the "Load Profile" menu item. Notethat when you load a profile from the library, the settings are not automatically written to the device - to load the settings into the device, you must tap the "Apply" button at the bottom of the screen.
