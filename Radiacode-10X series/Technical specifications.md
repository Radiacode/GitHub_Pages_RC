# Technical specifications

Portable dosimeter personal radiation detector Radiacode-10X series is designed to assess the radiation situation in real time. In addition, the instrument automatically keeps a log of measurement results and events. This makes it possible to analyze them, including with the help of standard software on a smartphone or personal computer. The dosimeter is suitable for work on the ground, with samples of construction materials, with specially selected and prepared food or soil samples.

The instrument has high sensitivity to gamma and X-ray radiation.\
It is suitable for assessing dose rate, accumulated dose, absorbed radiation energy spectrum and radiation hazard warning.

### Instrument features

* Fast response to changes in the radiation environment, thanks to the CsI(Tl) scintillator detector working together with a silicon photomultiplier tube and adaptive processing of incoming data.
* Continuous assessment of the radiation situation as long as the instrument is switched on. Results at any moment can be presented in the form of dose rate, count rate, accumulated dose, absorbed radiation energy spectrum. Assessment and accumulation of data do not depend on the change of the display mode.
* Splash-proof, dust-proof - IP64 class.
* Loong autonomous operation from the built-in battery.
* Independent alarm thresholds for count rate exceedance, dose rate exceedance and accumulateddose exceedance. Possibility to set 2 thresholds for each value.
* Built-in non-volatile memory for data accumulation, the volume of about 1000 hours of autonomousobservations. Possibility to transfer data to a computer via USB and to a smartphone via Bluetooth. Storage of results in an external database. - Binding of results to geographic coordinates and display on Google and OSM maps when used in conjunction with a smartphone.
* Availability of a program for personal computer and applications for Android and IOS.
* Continuous development of the project. Possibility of software upgrades.
* Economical graphic display with automatic backlighting in the dark. Rotation of the image on the screen when the device is rotated.
* Sound, light and vibration alarms on the device, and the ability to duplicate them on a smartphone.
